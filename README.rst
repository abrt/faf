About FAF
=========

[![build status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/abrt/faf-devel/package/faf/status_image/last_build.png)](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/abrt/faf-devel/package/faf/)

Originated as Fedora Analysis Framework –
The ultimate tool to fix problems of application crashes.

FAF now collects thousands of reports a day
serving needs of three different projects:

- `CentOS <http://centos.org>`_
- `Fedora <http://fedoraproject.org>`_
- `Red Hat Enterprise Linux <http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux>`_

Live FAF instances:

- https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/faf/

FAF is part of the `ABRT project <http://github.com/abrt/>`_.

How it works
------------

Currently, typical crash reporting work-flow consists of generating so called
`ureport <http://abrt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ureport.html#ureport>`_
(micro report) designed to be completely anonymous so it can be sent
and processed automatically avoiding costly bugzilla queries and manpower.

FAF in this scenario works like a first line of defense — collecting
massive amounts of similar reports and responding with tracker URLs
in case of known problems.

If user is lucky enough to hit a unique issue not known by FAF,
reporting chain continues with reporting to bugzilla, more complex process
which requires user having a bugzilla account and going through numerous steps
including verification that the report doesn't contain sensitive data.
