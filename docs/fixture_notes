faf-fixtures
-------------

Generates/loads fixtures for testing purposes.

Currently, there these types of fixtures are available:
    1) faf-fixtures --dumb
    2) faf-fixtures --realworld

Dumb fixtures are only good for web UI testing,
they are generated randomly and contain fake
symbols, components, ...

Real-world fixtures are also usable for
retracing and backtrace processing, they
contain real data (components, builds, rpms, tags, ..).

These data are partially stored in SQL files
`pyfaf/storage/fixtures/sql` directory. As we also need
RPM files to test retracing and uReport handling, these
are packed and stored in some other location than git.
During the fixture generation process, this file
is downloaded and extracted to faf lob dir.

URL pointing to downloaded archive is stored in
`pyfaf/storage/fixtures/lob_download_location`.

To create updated version of real-world fixtures,
edit and run `faf-fixtures-update-realworld` script,
which downloads specified components, updates
affected SQL files and packs new lob archive.

When you are happy with the new version, upload the
archive publicly and update `lob_download_location`
respectively.
